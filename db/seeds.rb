Teams from the motorsports and production worked hand-in-hand, sharing just under 50% of the same parts as the R8 GT3 LMS race car. The main attraction of the R8 is the 5.2-liter V10 FSI® engine, which produces 532 hp of power and 398 lb-ft of torque. Taking it up a notch, the R8 V10 plus cranks out 602 hp and 413 lb-ft of torque. ")

Crazy expensive, it’s capable of amazing performance without feeling as if it’s going to spin out into a ditch, which is refreshing in a supercar. Available as an S coupe or S roadster, it has a 730-hp 6.5-liter V-12, a seven-speed automated-manual transmission, and all-wheel drive. To help put all that power to pavement, each Aventador has monstrous tires, rear-wheel steering, and adaptive suspension.")

Seven examples, including one prototype, were built during 2014 and 2015.

This was one of the most exclusive production car programs ever envisaged in the car industry.

The hp-to-kg curb weight ratio is an astonishing 1:1. This is the “dream” equation, previously thought impossible when it comes to fully road legal and usable sports cars. The One:1 is the first homologated production car in the world with one Megawatt of power, thereby making it the world´s first series produced Megacar.

Thus, the name One:1.
